# Milestone 2

The second milestone builds on Milestone 1 by including a single slot proof voting strategy, an execution strategy utilizing a Zodiac module on L1, and finally an L1 voting contract and a corresponding auth contract on L2. Additionally, we update the space contract to take an array of voting and auth strategies rather than just a single option for each.

(The standard strategy that will enable voting power to be found via the balances of erc20 and erc721 tokens)


## Flows

The additional flow added to Milestone 2 is the process of voting and proposing via an L1 transaction. We highlight that no signature is needed in this case. This will enable smart contract accounts to interact with Snapshot X along with EOAs that do not want to interact via L2 (This may be the case for various reasons).  

### Create a proposal via L1 

This is the flow to create a proposal via an L1 transaction.

- 1: User submits a transaction to the global L1 voting contract with parameters: **space**, **executionHash**, and **metdataURI**. These correspond respectively to the address of the space the user wants to create a proposal in, the hash of the execution details, and the URI of the metadata. 
- 2: The contract then submits a transaction to StarkNet over the messaging bridge with the destination address immutably set in the contract as the L1 Tx Authenticator, and the payload as the parameters supplied.
- 3: The L1 Tx Authenticator receives the message and stores the payload parameters, it now waits for the strategy parameters to be submitted.
- 4: ??

### Cast a vote via L1
